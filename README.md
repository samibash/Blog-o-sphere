# Blog-o-sphere

# Summary:
I'm planning to build a blogging app for writers who want to broadcast their opinions on topics that are important to them, and have other bloggers comment and react to each others’ pieces so it becomes a lively dialogue.


# Technologies Used:
-React  
-Sequelize

-Express

-Bulma

# User Story:
I think my users are people who enjoy and are excited to express their views on important topics and share them with friends, family, and strangers alike.

    “As an opinionated writer, I want to write my thoughts down on a particular issue online so that i can have an audience of strangers/friends/family that will read, react, and comment on them.”

# MVP
Users being able to create a written piece
=> updating that same piece
=> reading that same piece
=> and deleting that same piece

# Post-MVP
Auth login
Profile creation, other users
Commenting on other user's pieces
